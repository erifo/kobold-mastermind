# Kobold Mastermind
Four kobolds delve into a dungeon on their first adventure. They get trapped inside a room with a very tall ceiling where the only way out is to solve a puzzle. There are four magical circles on the floor, each belonging to a specific kobold, but not revealing which. If the kobolds stand in their correct circles at the same time, they can escape with the treasure! But if they stand incorrectly, crystals on the wall show how many of them stand correctly and the ceiling lowers by a foot.
